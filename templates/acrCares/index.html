          <p>The ACR Cares initiative has been a dream of ours for a while and we are so excited that it is finally coming to fruition. Our team of volunteers has been meeting over the past year praying and seeking Gods will and asking how we can better care for our fellow team members, neighbors and our communities. Through a lot of prayer and discussion we developed the following statement that we believe captures our passion to serve. “Our mission is to honor God by showing His love and mercy to the ACR Family and our community through caring in everyday life”. If you look in Gods word you will see that Philippians 2:4 says that we should “not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others”. And in Acts 20:35 it states “In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive”.</p>
